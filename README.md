# Minesweeper Game

This project is a graphical implementation of the classic Minesweeper game using Python's Tkinter library

## Overview

Minesweeper is a classic puzzle game where players click on a grid of squares to uncover hidden mines. The goal is to clear the grid without detonating a mine, requiring strategy and attention to detail.

## Installation and Running

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x (tested on Python 3.9)
* Tkinter library (comes bundled with Python)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository using Git:
git clone https://github.com/Medjai229/minesweeper.git

cd minesweeper

### Running the Game

1. Run the game using Python:
python3 minesweeper.py

2. Follow the instructions on the screen to play the game.
3. To exit the game, press the "q" key.

This will launch the Minesweeper game window. Click on the squares to start playing!

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, ensure that you have Python 3.x installed and Tkinter is available. You can check by running `python --version` and `python -c "import tkinter; print(tkinter.Tk())"` in your terminal.

If you're still facing issues, feel free to open an issue on this repository, and I'll be happy to help!
